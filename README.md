# interaction_terms_simulation
R simulation to illustrate how changes in estimated gender pay gaps in an excluded reference industry do not impact pay gap estimates in other sectors (when estimating pay gaps via male x industry interaction terms). 

Data files consists of three industries (A, B, C) with 30 workers each, 15 male and 15 female. First data file has a 5 percent gender pay gap in Industry A, while the second file has a 10 percent pay gap for Industry A. 

R similation shows how the estimated pay gap in Industry B and C do not change when the pay gap in the omitted reference category of Industry A changes.
